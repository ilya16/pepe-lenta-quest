## Problem statement

Current system of personalized recommendations in Lenta app:
* Complicated system of special offers: personal offers in the app + general offers in SMS + surprize cards in the stores
* No possibility to affect on special offers

## Concept

The solution is a symbiosis of two pillars:
* ***Personalized tasks*** based on the history of transactions for engaging customers:
  * tasks based on previously bought and novel products
  * tasks in different product categories
* ***A system of achievements*** with rewards and bonuses:
  * category based
  * product based
  * location based
  
Task personalization is provided by a multilayer recommendation system working with the following levels of item granularity in transaction data:
* `material`s (products)
* `hier_level_2` categories
* `hier_level_3` categories
* `hier_level_4` categories
* `vendor`s

Each model is a Collaborative Filtering for implicit feedback datasets based on [Alternating Least Squares](https://implicit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/als.html).

Using multiple models we can offer personalized recommendations with various levels of product description: from raw products and their properties to vendors and categories.

See [demo](demo.ipynb) for more details. The business side of the solution is shortly presented in the [video](https://youtu.be/KHpbMbEsKXk).
